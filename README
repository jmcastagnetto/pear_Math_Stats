Math_Stats

Package to calculate statistical parameters of numerical arrays
of data. The data can be in a simple numerical array, or in a 
cummulative numerical array. A cummulative array, has the value
as the index and the number of repeats as the value for the
array item, e.g. $data = array(3=>4, 2.3=>5, 1.25=>6, 0.5=>3).
Nulls can be rejected, ignored or handled as zero values.</description>

This is old code I wrote for PEAR. Originally it was tracked in CVS,
then it was moved to SVN, and now I am importing it to git :-)
